## Job Insights

CS project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

My first project with __Python__ made to improve my skills with the language. In this project I implemented an analysis from a dataset about jobs. These implementations were incorporated into a web application powered by _Flask_. I also had the opportunity to write tests for implementing a data analysis.
