## Job Insights

CS project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

My first project with __Python__ made to improve my skills with the language. In this project I implemented an analysis from a dataset about jobs. These implementations were incorporated into a web application powered by _Flask_. I also had the opportunity to write tests for implementing a data analysis.

### How to run the project

```bash
    # Clone the repository
    $ git clone git@github.com:RafaelCunhaS/Project-Job-Insights.git

    # Go into the project's directory
    $ cd Project-Job-Insights

    # Create your own virtual environment
    $ python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    
    # Install the dependencies
    $ python3 -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
    
    # And run the project with Flask
    $ Flask run
```
The project will be running on your [localhost:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
